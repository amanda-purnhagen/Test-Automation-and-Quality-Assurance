# Test-Automation-and-Quality-Assurance
Demonstrates my ability to run tests on my code to ensure the highest quality software. This code is from a Maven project using JUnit 5.

## How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
I will ensure that all my future code, programs, and pieces of software are functional by thoroughly testing each functionality. I will do this by getting a thorough understanding of customer requirements and attempting to break the code with the help of equivalence partitioning and boundary values. To make sure the work is secure, I will maintain a security mindset throughout all my projects. Additionally, I will implement strict limits for data input and stay up to date with cyber security news.

## How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
User needs are the crux of every software development project. The reason for writing any benign program is to solve users' problems. Therefore, it benefits the developers, users, and stakeholders alike when the developers remain focused on the tasks at hand, making sure to meet every individual need conveniently and efficiently.

## How do I approach designing software?
I approach designing software with a mindset focused on collaboration, quality, efficiency, and security. These are four pillars of software development that I strongly believe should be used to constantly strive for excellence.
